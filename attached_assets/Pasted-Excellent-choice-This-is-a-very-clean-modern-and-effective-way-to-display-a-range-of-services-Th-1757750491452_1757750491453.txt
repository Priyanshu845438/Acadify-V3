Excellent choice. This is a very clean, modern, and effective way to display a range of services. The central illustration is a brilliant design choice that breaks the grid's monotony and adds a human touch.

Here is the complete breakdown to recreate this section perfectly.

1. The AI UI Generation Prompt

This prompt is crafted to generate a high-fidelity visual that your developer can use as a precise target.

"UI design for an 'IT Services' section of a corporate website. The design is minimalist, clean, and organized around a central illustration.

Layout & Elements:

Headline: A prominent, center-aligned headline at the top. Text: 'Reach out to the world's most reliable IT services.' The words 'IT services' are highlighted in the primary blue color (#0D6EFD) and have a short blue underline accent.

Grid: A 3-column grid of service cards. The grid has 8 cards in total, with the centermost position (the 5th slot) being occupied by an illustration, not a card.

Service Cards:

Style: Clean white cards with soft, rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow to make them appear floating.

Content Hierarchy:

A rounded-square icon with a solid blue background and a white glyph inside (e.g., a code bracket, a globe).

A bold service title in dark charcoal text (e.g., 'Digital Marketing').

A short, 2-3 line description in a lighter gray text.

A 'Discover now →' link at the bottom in the primary blue color.

Central Illustration: A modern, flat-style illustration of a person sitting at a desk and working on a computer. The illustration should have a friendly and professional aesthetic, using a muted color palette that complements the website's primary blue.

The overall background is a clean white. The design should feel spacious, trustworthy, and high-fidelity."

2. The Developer's Blueprint (HTML & Bootstrap Structure)

This is the practical code to build the section. It uses Bootstrap 5's grid system and card components for a fully responsive structure.

3. Functionality & Mobile Responsive Instructions

Custom CSS for Hover Effect: The design has a subtle elegance. Add a small hover effect to the cards to make them feel interactive.

.card {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-8px);
    box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) !important;
}

Icons: The code uses Bootstrap Icons. Ensure you have the icon font linked in your project. You can easily replace bi bi-code-slash with any other icon from their library.

Mobile Responsive Behavior (Crucial):

Desktop (lg and up): The grid will be a 3-column layout. The central illustration will be visible (d-lg-block), creating the exact look from the image.

Tablet (md): The grid will become a 2-column layout (col-md-6). All cards will be visible, and the illustration will be hidden to maintain a clean grid.

Mobile (smaller than md): The grid will stack into a 1-column layout. Each card will take up the full width, providing a clear, scrollable list of services.

The Illustration's Role: The key to the responsive design is hiding the illustration on smaller screens. The classes d-none d-lg-block on the illustration's column do exactly this:

d-none: The element is hidden by default (on mobile).

d-lg-block: The element becomes visible (display: block) only on large screens and up. This prevents an awkward gap in the grid on tablet and mobile views.
