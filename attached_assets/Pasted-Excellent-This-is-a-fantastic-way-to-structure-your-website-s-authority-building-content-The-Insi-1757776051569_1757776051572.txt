Excellent. This is a fantastic way to structure your website's authority-building content. The "Insights" folder should be the ultimate destination for any potential client looking for proof of your expertise and success.

Here is a set of detailed prompts to design each of these pages. They are designed to be cohesive, professional, and to reuse the components we've already defined, ensuring a consistent theme and faster development.

Overarching Strategy for the "Insights" Section

The overview.html page will act as a central "Insights Hub". It will be a beautifully designed dashboard that provides a taste of all the other pages and funnels users to the specific proof they are looking for, whether that's a blog post, a case study, or a client testimonial.

1. overview.html (The Insights Hub)

Purpose: To serve as the main landing page for the "Insights" section, providing a high-level summary of your thought leadership, successful projects, and client satisfaction.

Prompt:

"UI design for an 'Insights Hub' overview page. This page must feel like a dynamic, content-rich dashboard that establishes authority.

Page Structure & Components:

Hero Section: A clean header with the title 'Insights & Expertise' and a short tagline: 'Explore our proven success, industry knowledge, and client stories.'

Featured Blog Post: A full-width component showcasing your latest or most popular article. Use a large image, the title, and an excerpt with a 'Read More' button.

Featured Case Study: A prominent, two-column section highlighting your most impressive case study. Left side has the client logo, challenge, and solution summary. Right side has a compelling visual from the project.

"Recent Work" Snapshot: A 3-column grid that displays the 3 most recent projects from your portfolio. Use the Case Study Card component for this. Headline: 'Our Latest Projects'.

"Client Voices" Section: A testimonial slider component (or a 2-column grid of two powerful quotes) to showcase social proof. Headline: 'What Our Clients Say'.

The design must be clean, modular, and use the established brand theme to create a cohesive and professional experience."

2. blogs.html (The Blog Archive)

Purpose: To house all your articles and establish thought leadership. The design must prioritize readability and easy navigation.

Prompt:

"UI design for the main Blog Archive page. The layout should be clean, content-first, and highly navigable.

Category Filters: A row of filter buttons or pills (e.g., 'All', 'Web Development', 'Marketing', 'Industry News') below the header to allow users to sort posts.
