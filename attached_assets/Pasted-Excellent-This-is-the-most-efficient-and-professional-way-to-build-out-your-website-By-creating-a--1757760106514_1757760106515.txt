1. The Master AI UI Generation Prompt (For All Service Pages)

Hero Header: A powerful, benefit-driven headline about [Service Name]. To the right, a high-quality visual element (mockup or illustration) that clearly represents [Service Name].

Introductory Section: A two-column layout explaining the strategic importance of [Service Name] for businesses.

"Our [Service Name] Services" (Tabs): An interactive Bootstrap Tab component showcasing specific sub-services, such as [Sub-Service 1], [Sub-Service 2], and [Sub-Service 3].
