Of course. Your feedback is spot on. The original design concept is strong, but it feels disjointedâ€”like two separate boxes pushed together. The diagonal line is an attempt to connect them, but it doesn't quite create a unified, professional component.

To improve this and make it truly professional, we need to create a sense of depth, layering, and deliberate connection.

The New, Improved Design Concept: The Overlapping Card

Instead of placing the content inside the two colored backgrounds, we will create a single, clean, white testimonial card that sits on top of the background and physically overlaps the two halves. This immediately unifies the entire section, creates a premium layered effect, and improves the visual flow.

1. The AI UI Generation Prompt (For the New, Professional Design)

This prompt describes the improved, cohesive version for your developer's visual reference.

"UI design for a modern, professional, and visually integrated 'testimonial-cta' section. The design must feel cohesive and layered.

Background Layout:

A full-width, two-part background. The left 60% is a very light gray (#F8F9FA), and the right 40% is a deep, professional navy blue (#0A2540).

Overlapping Testimonial Card:

A large, clean, white card is positioned to overlap the center of the section, sitting on top of both the gray and blue backgrounds.

The card has soft, rounded corners and a prominent drop shadow to create a sense of depth and make it feel like it's floating.

Inside the Card:

A Bootstrap Carousel for the testimonials.

Each slide contains a large, primary blue quotation mark icon, the bold headline 'What Our Clients Say', the testimonial text, and the client's circular photo with their name and title.

The carousel controls (next/previous arrows) are minimalist and positioned neatly at the bottom.

Call-to-Action Area (on the blue background):

To the right of the overlapping card, on the navy blue background.

A large, impactful headline in white, bold text: 'Ready to Start Your Project?'

A supporting paragraph in a muted white text.

Two distinct call-to-action buttons: one solid white ('Get a Free Quote') and one with a white outline ('Learn More').

The final design must look like a single, premium component, not two separate halves. The overlapping card is the key element."

2. The Developer's Blueprint (HTML & Bootstrap Structure)

This structure uses relative and absolute positioning to create the layered effect, while Bootstrap's grid handles the content.

3. The Crucial CSS for the Professional Look

This CSS creates the background split and manages the layout.

.testimonial-cta-section {
  overflow: hidden; /* Prevents horizontal scroll */
}

/* The dark blue panel on the right */
.cta-panel {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 45%; /* Adjust the split point */
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #0A2540; /* A professional navy blue */
  z-index: 1;
}

/* --- MOBILE RESPONSIVE ADJUSTMENTS --- */
@media (max-width: 991.98px) {
  /* On mobile, we stack instead of overlap */
  .cta-panel {
    position: relative; /* Change from absolute to relative */
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    padding: 4rem 1rem; /* Give it its own space */
  }

  .testimonial-cta-section .card {
    margin-bottom: 2rem; /* Add space between the card and the CTA panel */
    box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0,0,0,.15)!important; /* Keep a nice shadow */
  }
  
  .testimonial-cta-section .col-lg-5 {
    padding-left: 1rem !important; /* Reset desktop padding */
  }
}
4. Mobile Responsive Instructions

The CSS media query handles the mobile experience gracefully:

Desktop (lg and up): The stunning overlapping card design is in full effect, providing the professional, layered look.

Tablet & Mobile (below lg): The complex overlapping layout is too difficult to manage on a narrow screen. The design intelligently transforms:

The .cta-panel (dark blue background) becomes a normal, full-width block instead of an absolutely positioned panel.

The Bootstrap grid naturally stacks the columns.

The result is a clean, vertical layout: the white testimonial card appears first, and the dark blue CTA section appears directly below it. This is the most user-friendly and logical flow for a mobile device.
