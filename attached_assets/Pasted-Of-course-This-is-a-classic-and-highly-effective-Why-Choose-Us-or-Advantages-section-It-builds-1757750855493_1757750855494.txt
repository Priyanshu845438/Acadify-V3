Of course. This is a classic and highly effective "Why Choose Us" or "Advantages" section. It builds trust by clearly communicating your core value propositions.

Here is the complete guide to implementing this section, from the visual prompt to the developer's code and responsive instructions.

1. The AI UI Generation Prompt

This prompt will generate a high-fidelity visual for your developer, perfectly capturing the clean and professional aesthetic of your example.

"UI design for a 'Why Choose Us' section for a corporate IT services website. The background is a very light gray (#F8F9FA).

Header Area:

All content is center-aligned.

An 'eyebrow' text at the top in small, uppercase, primary blue letters: 'WHY CHOOSE US'.

A large, bold main headline below it. The text is: 'The Acadify Advantage Over Others'. The words 'Acadify Advantage' should be rendered in the primary blue color (#0D6EFD), while the rest of the text is a dark charcoal.

A short, thick blue accent line is positioned directly under the highlighted 'Acadify Advantage' text.

Features Grid:

A 3-column grid of six feature cards.

Card Style: The cards are white with soft, rounded corners and a very subtle drop shadow. They have no visible border.

Card Content:

At the top of each card, there is a feature icon. The icon itself is a white, outline-style glyph presented inside a soft, light-blue, rounded square container.

A bold, dark charcoal title (e.g., 'Quick Response').

A 2-3 line descriptive paragraph in a muted gray text.

The overall design is spacious, clean, and highly professional, conveying trust and reliability."

2. The Developer's Blueprint (HTML & Bootstrap Structure)

This is the practical code to build the section. It's fully responsive and uses standard Bootstrap 5 components.

3. Functionality & Custom CSS

Icons: The code uses Bootstrap Icons (bi). To get the desired icon style (light blue background, blue icon), we can use a combination of Bootstrap's background and opacity utility classes: bg-primary bg-opacity-10 text-primary. This is a modern and easy way to achieve the effect. However, a custom class is cleaner:

Custom CSS (Recommended for Icons & Hover): Add this to your main stylesheet for better control and a polished look.

/* Style for the feature icons */
.feature-icon {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 4rem; /* 64px */
    height: 4rem; /* 64px */
}

/* A subtle hover effect for the cards */
.card {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-8px);
    box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) !important;
}
4. Mobile Responsive Instructions

The provided Bootstrap code is already fully responsive. Here is the breakdown of how it will behave:

Desktop (lg screens, ≥992px): The col-lg-4 class will create the intended 3-column layout, with three cards per row.

Tablets (md screens, ≥768px): The col-md-6 class will take effect, and the layout will automatically reflow into a 2-column layout. This is a great user experience on tablets.

Mobile (screens smaller than 768px): Since there are no smaller col-sm-* classes, Bootstrap's mobile-first grid will default to a 1-column layout. The cards will stack vertically, each taking up the full width of the container, which is ideal for readability and tapping on a small screen.
