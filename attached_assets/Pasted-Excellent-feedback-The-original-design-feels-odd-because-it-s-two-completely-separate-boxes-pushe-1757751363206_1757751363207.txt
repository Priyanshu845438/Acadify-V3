Excellent feedback. The original design feels "odd" because it's two completely separate boxes pushed together. It lacks integration and flow. To make it "attractive and professional" and honor your request to "remove top bottom margin," we need to create a single, seamless, and dynamic component.

Here is a much more modern and cohesive design concept, along with the prompts and code to build it.

The New Design Concept: The Diagonal Split

Instead of a harsh vertical line, we will use a dynamic diagonal cut to separate the two sections. This creates a sense of movement, connects the two halves visually, and makes the entire component feel like a single, premium design piece. It will be a full-width section, touching the edges of the browser.

1. The AI UI Generation Prompt (For the New Design)

This prompt describes the improved, professional version for your developer's visual reference.

"UI design for a modern, full-width, combined Testimonial and Call-to-Action section. The component must feel premium, seamless, and integrated.

Overall Layout:

The section is full-width (edge-to-edge of the screen).

A dynamic diagonal line cuts across the section, visually separating the left and right areas.

Left Area (Testimonials):

Background: A very light gray (#F8F9FA).

Content: A clean and elegant testimonial slider.

A large, primary blue quotation mark icon at the top.

A bold headline: 'What Our Clients Say'.

The testimonial text is prominent and highly readable.

Below the text, a circular client photo is positioned next to their name and title.

The slider controls (subtle arrows and small dot indicators) are minimalist and clean.

Right Area (Call to Action):

Background: The primary blue color (#0D6EFD).

Content (Vertically Centered):

A large, bold, multi-line headline in white: 'Ready to Start Your Project?'

A supporting paragraph in a slightly muted white text.

Two professional buttons: one solid white ('Get a Free Quote') and one with a white outline ('Learn More').

The design must look like a single, cohesive unit, not two separate boxes. The diagonal separation is the key visual feature. High-fidelity rendering."

2. The Developer's Blueprint (HTML & Bootstrap Structure)

This structure uses a parent container for the diagonal background and Bootstrap's grid for the content inside.

3. The Crucial CSS for the Diagonal Effect

This is what makes the new design work. Add this to your main stylesheet.

.testimonial-cta-section {
  position: relative;
  background-color: #f8f9fa; /* The light gray for the left side */
  overflow: hidden; /* Important for the pseudo-element */
}

/* This pseudo-element creates the blue diagonal shape */
.testimonial-cta-section::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #0D6EFD; /* The primary blue */
  
  /* The magic for the diagonal cut */
  clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 40% 100%);
  
  z-index: 1;
}

/* Custom styles for carousel controls to match the professional look */
.carousel-controls {
  position: relative;
  width: 100px;
}
.carousel-controls .carousel-control-prev,
.carousel-controls .carousel-control-next {
  position: static;
  display: inline-block;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
.carousel-controls .carousel-control-prev:hover,
.carousel-controls .carousel-control-next:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}

/* --- MOBILE RESPONSIVE ADJUSTMENTS --- */
@media (max-width: 991.98px) {
  /* On tablets and mobile, remove the diagonal cut */
  .testimonial-cta-section::before {
    clip-path: none; /* Disables the clip-path */
    height: 50%;     /* Makes the blue cover the bottom half */
    top: 50%;        /* Positions the blue at the bottom */
  }
  
  /* We need to re-style the section to stack properly */
  .testimonial-cta-section {
    background-color: #f8f9fa; /* Top half background */
  }
  
  .testimonial-cta-section .col-lg-6 {
     text-align: center !important; /* Center all text on mobile */
  }
}
4. Mobile Responsive Instructions

The CSS above includes a media query that handles the responsiveness perfectly:

Desktop (lg and up): The stunning diagonal split is visible, creating the dynamic, professional look.

Tablet & Mobile (below lg): The diagonal cut is too complex for a narrow screen. Instead, the component gracefully degrades to a stacked layout:

The ::before pseudo-element loses its clip-path and is repositioned to cover the bottom 50% of the section.

The section's main background provides the light gray for the top 50%.

The Bootstrap grid automatically stacks the columns, so the Testimonial content appears in the top gray area, and the CTA content appears in the bottom blue area.

This approach gives you a "wow" factor on desktop while providing a clean, clear, and logical user experience on mobile devices.
