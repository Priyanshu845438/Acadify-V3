Of course. This is a critical page. A service page needs to be more than just a list of features; it must be a compelling sales pitch that guides a potential client from interest to inquiry. It needs to build trust, demonstrate expertise, and make the next step obvious.

Following your established theme, here is a complete, professional, and attractive blueprint for the /pages/services/app-development.html page, designed component by component.

The AI UI Generation Prompt

This is the master prompt for your developer to visualize the entire page.

"UI design for a professional 'App Development' service page for a technology company, Acadify Solution. The page must follow the established brand theme (Primary Blue: #0D6EFD, Dark Navy: #0A2540, Fonts: Poppins/Roboto) and feel spacious, modern, and trustworthy.

The page is structured as a top-to-bottom narrative, composed of the following components in order:

Hero Header: A powerful, benefit-driven headline with a mockup of an app on a smartphone.

Introductory Section: A two-column layout explaining the importance of mobile apps.

Our App Services (Tabs): An interactive Bootstrap Tab component to showcase expertise in iOS, Android, and Hybrid development.

Technology Stack: A clean grid of technology logos (Swift, Kotlin, React Native, etc.).

Development Process: A visual, step-by-step timeline graphic.

Featured Projects: A grid of 2-3 relevant case study cards that open a modal on click.

FAQ Section: A Bootstrap Accordion to answer common questions.

Final CTA: A dedicated, full-width Call to Action section with a contact form.

The overall design must be clean, with a clear visual hierarchy, and guide the user logically down the page. High-fidelity rendering."
